# Ticket Priority Classification

### This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models to classify text data into different categories. It is built using PyTorch and includes custom training and evaluation functions.

### Features

  - CNN Classifier for learning spatial relationships in text embeddings.
  - MLP (Dense) Classifier for a fully connected neural network approach.
  - Support for multi-class classification with CrossEntropy loss.
