## Project Overview

The Ticket Priority Classification project utilizes both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models to analyze and classify ticket descriptions based on their urgency. Built with PyTorch, the system incorporates custom training and evaluation routines to ensure high accuracy and efficiency in multi-class classification tasks.

## Key Features

- **CNN Classifier:**  
  Exploits spatial relationships in text embeddings to capture intricate features for improved classification performance.

- **MLP (Dense) Classifier:**  
  Employs a fully connected neural network approach to model complex decision boundaries effectively.

- **Multi-Class Classification:**  
  Supports the assignment of multiple priority levels using CrossEntropy loss for robust and accurate predictions.
